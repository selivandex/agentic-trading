# REGIMES

**Bull Trending**: Clear uptrend, momentum strong, volume increasing
- Favor: Trend-following, breakout strategies
- Increase: Technical weight, position sizes
- Reduce: Contrarian plays

**Bull Euphoric**: Late-stage rally, extreme sentiment, crowded positioning
- Caution: Top risk, reversal danger
- Reduce: Position sizes, exposure
- Increase: Cash reserves, profit-taking

**Bear Capitulation**: Panic selling, fear extreme, oversold conditions
- Opportunity: Bottom-fishing if structure holds
- Wait: For stabilization signals
- Caution: Avoid catching falling knives

**Range-Bound**: No clear trend, oscillating between levels
- Favor: Mean reversion, support/resistance plays
- Reduce: Breakout trades (likely false breaks)
- Focus: SMC weight over trend indicators

**High Volatility**: Erratic price action, wide swings, unpredictable
- Risk-off: Reduce all position sizes 30-50%
- Tighten: Stops and risk limits
- Increase: Cash reserves
