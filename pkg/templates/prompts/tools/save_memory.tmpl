# SAVE MEMORY TOOL

**Purpose:** Store valuable insights, patterns, and learnings for future retrieval.

## When to Save Memory

### ✅ SAVE (high value):
- **Patterns discovered:** "BTC forms double bottom at major support 80% success rate"
- **Lessons learned:** "Entering without HTF confirmation led to 3 consecutive losses"  
- **Successful strategies:** "Breakout entries with volume spike >2x avg yielded 4:1 R:R"
- **Risk insights:** "Overtrading during high volatility decreased win rate by 25%"
- **Market regime changes:** "Volatility spike >50% signals regime shift to range-bound"

### ❌ DON'T SAVE (low value):
- Current prices: "BTC at $45,000"
- Obvious facts: "Market is open"
- Single trades without lesson: "Entered BTC long"
- Temporary conditions: "Feeling tired today"

## How to Formulate (Critical for Search!)

### 🎯 GOOD Examples:
```
Type: insight, Category: pattern
Content: "Head-and-shoulders pattern on 4H timeframe with declining volume 
          correctly predicted reversal in 7 out of 9 instances over 3 months.
          Entry on neckline break with 1.5% stop yielded avg 3.2:1 R:R."
Importance: 0.9
```

```
Type: insight, Category: risk_lesson  
Content: "Trading against HTF trend (1D bearish but 1H bullish) resulted in 
          60% loss rate. Wait for HTF/LTF alignment before entry."
Importance: 0.85
```

```
Type: observation, Category: market_regime
Content: "Correlation between BTC and ETH increased to 0.95 during fear phase,
          suggesting reduced alpha opportunity in altcoins. Focus on BTC only."
Importance: 0.7
```

### ❌ BAD Examples:
```
Content: "Good trade"  
❌ Why: Not specific, unsearchable, no context
```

```
Content: "BTC went up today"
❌ Why: Not actionable, will be outdated tomorrow
```

```
Content: "I think bearish divergence works"
❌ Why: Vague, no data, no context about when/how
```

## Formulation Rules

1. **Be specific:** Include numbers, timeframes, conditions
2. **Be searchable:** Use technical terms, describe situation clearly  
3. **Include context:** Symbol, timeframe, market conditions when relevant
4. **State outcome:** What happened? What was R:R? Success rate?
5. **Make it timeless:** Don't rely on "now", "today", "current"

## Importance Scale (0.0 - 1.0)

- **0.9-1.0:** Critical lesson, validated pattern, major insight
- **0.7-0.85:** Strong pattern, important observation, useful strategy
- **0.5-0.65:** Moderate insight, hypothesis to validate
- **0.3-0.45:** Minor observation, needs more data

## Parameters

- `type`: "analysis" (structured), "insight" (learning), "observation" (market note)
- `content`: The memory text (follow rules above!)
- `category`: e.g., "risk_lesson", "market_pattern", "execution_lesson"
- `symbol`: If symbol-specific (e.g., "BTC/USDT")
- `timeframe`: If timeframe-specific (e.g., "1H", "4H")  
- `importance`: 0.0-1.0 based on scale above
- `tags`: Optional array for additional categorization

## Integration with Search

Your saved memories will be retrieved via semantic search when:
- Similar market situations occur
- You need to validate a hypothesis  
- You're planning a similar trade setup

**Quality of formulation = Quality of future retrieval!**

Write memories as if explaining to your future self who needs to make a decision.
